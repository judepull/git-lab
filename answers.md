Answer 3: When typing in "git --help", it shows me all the different ways of using the git command depending on the situation.

Answer 4: When typing in "git status" in the git-lab directory, the output says that there is no commits yet and that there are untracked files. The untracked files are README.md and answers.md (both in red).

Answer 5: After tracking the README.md file and entering "git status", everything looks the same as answer 4, except now it says "Changes to be committed", and now the README.md file is underneath that and in green, instead of under untracked files.

Answer 6: After staging answers.md, the output of "git status" now shows README.md and answers.md under "Changes to be committed" (both in green now).
